# Advanced Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents hands-on Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) activities performed in controlled lab environments. The objective is to demonstrate practical skills in exploit chaining, web application security testing, post-exploitation, evidence handling, and professional security reporting.

The work follows industry-recognized methodologies such as OWASP WSTG and PTES and is intended for learning, skill validation, and portfolio demonstration purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and demonstrate multi-stage exploit chains
- Customize public exploits for specific environments
- Identify and exploit common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Perform post-exploitation and evidence collection
- Produce professional penetration testing reports for both technical and non-technical audiences

---

## 🧪 Lab Environment
- **Operating System:** Kali Linux
- **Target Machines:** DVWA, Metasploitable2
- **Testing Type:** Black-box / Gray-box
- **Tools Used:** Burp Suite, Metasploit, sqlmap, OpenVAS, Wireshark

### 🔹 01-Advanced-Exploitation
Covers exploit chaining concepts, proof-of-concept customization, and obfuscation techniques used to bypass basic defenses.

### 🔹 02-Web-App-Pentesting
Contains manual and automated testing results for web applications, including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws.

### 🔹 03-Reporting
Includes executive summaries, technical findings, CVSS scoring, and management-level security briefs.

### 🔹 04-Post-Exploitation
Demonstrates privilege escalation techniques and evidence collection with proper chain-of-custody considerations.

### 🔹 05-Capstone
Simulates a full VAPT engagement from reconnaissance to exploitation, remediation, and final reporting.

## 📊 Methodology
- OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)
- Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
- Manual testing prioritized over automated scanning
- Findings validated and documented with remediation guidance

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All testing activities documented in this repository were conducted in intentionally vulnerable lab environments. These techniques are for educational purposes only. Unauthorized testing of systems without explicit permission is illegal.
