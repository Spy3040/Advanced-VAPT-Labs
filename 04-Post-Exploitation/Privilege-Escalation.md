# Privilege Escalation – Post-Exploitation Phase

## Initial Access
An initial Meterpreter session was assumed to be established on the target system with limited user privileges.

## Escalation Technique
The Metasploit module `exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated` was reviewed to assess privilege escalation opportunities.

## Description
The AlwaysInstallElevated misconfiguration allows Windows Installer packages to be executed with elevated privileges when specific registry keys are enabled. 
If exploited, a low-privileged user can escalate to SYSTEM-level access.

## Outcome
This technique demonstrates how misconfigurations can be abused post-exploitation to gain higher privileges on a compromised system.
