Exploit Chain:

 For Example Chain (Web):
	XSS → Session Hijacking → Privileged Action
 		1. A reflected XSS vulnerability is identified in a search parameter.
2. An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload.
3. The payload captures the victim’s session cookie.
4. The stolen session cookie is reused to impersonate the victim.
5. If the victim is an administrator, the attacker gains privileged access.

Impact:
This exploit chain allows an attacker to escalate from a simple client-side vulnerability to full account takeover, potentially leading to unauthorized administrative actions.

Here in metasploitable-2 machine I use nmap to know the open ports & Services. Then by using metasploite-framework I gain the access in to the system and by using shell command I get the root level access.
