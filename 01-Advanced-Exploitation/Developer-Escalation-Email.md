Subject: Security Issue Identified – Chained Exploit Leading to RCE

Dear Development Team,
During a recent security assessment, we identified a chained exploitation scenario that could lead to remote code execution on the affected server. 
The issue originates from insufficient input validation and access control weaknesses, which can be combined to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary commands.
If exploited, this vulnerability may result in full system compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive data. 
We recommend sanitizing all user inputs, applying the latest patches, and reviewing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Please prioritize remediation and let us know if further clarification is required.

Regards,  
VAPT Analyst
