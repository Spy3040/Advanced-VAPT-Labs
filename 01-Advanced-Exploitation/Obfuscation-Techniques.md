Obfuscation Techniques Overview:

Attackers often use basic obfuscation techniques to bypass weak security filters and detection mechanisms.

Common Techniques:
URL encoding of malicious input
Case manipulation of HTML tags
Minor payload restructuring

Example:
<script>alert(1)</script>  
Encoded as:  
%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

Security Insight
These techniques highlight why server-side input validation and proper output encoding are critical for application security.
