# Management Brief

The security assessment identified weaknesses that could allow attackers to access sensitive data or disrupt application functionality. 
The most serious risks relate to improper input handling and weak login protections.

If these issues are not addressed, the organization may face increased risk of data breaches and service misuse. 
Remediation efforts should focus on improving authentication controls and validating all user input. Regular security testing and timely patching are recommended to maintain a strong security posture.
