# Executive Summary

A web application security assessment was conducted to evaluate the overall security posture of the target application. 
The assessment identified multiple vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access, manipulate application data, and compromise user accounts.

The most critical findings include SQL Injection and weak authentication mechanisms. 
If exploited, these vulnerabilities could lead to data breaches, loss of sensitive information, and reputational damage.

Immediate remediation is recommended to reduce risk exposure. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the application’s security and resilience against common attack techniques.
