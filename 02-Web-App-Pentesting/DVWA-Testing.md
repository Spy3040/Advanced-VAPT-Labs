🔹 A07: Identification & Authentication Failures
When an attacker is able to trick a system into recognizing an invalid or incorrect user as legitimate, this vulnerability is present. There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:
Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing, where the attacker has a breached list of valid usernames and passwords. More recently this type of attack has been expanded to include hybrid password attacks credential 
stuffing (also known as password spray attacks), where the attacker uses variations or increments of spilled credentials to gain access, for instance trying Password1!, Password2!, Password3! and so on.

1. Permits brute force or other automated, scripted attacks that are not quickly blocked.
2. Permits default, weak, or well-known passwords, such as "Password1" or "admin" username with an "admin" password
3. Allows users to create new accounts with already known-breached credentialsAllows use of weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password processes, such as "knowledge-based answers," which cannot be made safe.
4. Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords data stores (see A04:2025-Cryptographic Failures).
5. Has missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication.
6. Allows use of weak or ineffective fallbacks if multi-factor authentication is not available.
7. Exposes session identifier in the URL, a hidden field, or another insecure location that is accessible to the client.
8. Reuses the same session identifier after successful login.
9. Does not correctly invalidate user sessions or authentication tokens (mainly single sign-on (SSO) tokens) during logout or a period of inactivity.
10. Does not correctly assert the scope and intended audience of the provided credentials.

Example: 
  Weak login
  No rate limiting
  Brute force possible

🔹 A05:2025 - Injection 
An injection vulnerability is an application flaw that allows untrusted user input to be sent to an interpreter (e.g. a browser, database, the command line) and causes the interpreter to execute parts of that input as commands.

An application is vulnerable to attack when:

User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.
Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.
Unsanitized data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
Potentially hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.

Example:
  SQL Injection
  XSS

🔹 A06:2025 - Insecure Design
Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.” Insecure design is not the source for all other Top Ten risk categories. Note that there is a 
difference between insecure design and insecure implementation. We differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes, take place at different times in the development
process, and have different remediations. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as needed security 
controls were never created to defend against specific attacks. One of the factors that contributes to insecure design is the lack of business risk profiling inherent in the software or system being developed, and thus the failure 
to determine what level of security design is required.

Three key parts of having a secure design are:

Gathering Requirements and Resource Management
Creating a Secure Design
Having a Secure Development Lifecycle
