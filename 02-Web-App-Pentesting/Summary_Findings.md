## Summary
Web application testing identified critical vulnerabilities including SQL injection and broken authentication mechanisms. 
Manual testing revealed weak input validation and insufficient authentication controls, which could allow attackers to bypass 
login protections and access sensitive data. Immediate remediation is recommended to reduce security risk.

## Finding 001 – SQL Injection
OWASP Category: A03 – Injection  
Severity: Critical
Description:
User input is not properly validated, allowing attackers to manipulate backend SQL queries.
Impact:
An attacker could bypass authentication and access sensitive database data.
Remediation:
Use parameterized queries and strict server-side input validation.

## Finding 002 – Broken Authentication
OWASP Category: A07 – Identification and Authentication Failures  
Severity: High
Description:
The application allows unlimited login attempts without enforcing rate limiting.
Impact:
Attackers can perform brute-force attacks to compromise user accounts.
Remediation:
Implement rate limiting, CAPTCHA, and account lockout mechanisms.
